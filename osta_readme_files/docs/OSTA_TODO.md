## The per-epic ritual (repeat for EVERY epic below — not restated each time)

- [ ] Read the epic + its feature doc + [`OSTA_plan.md`](OSTA_plan.md) §2–§13; verify backend readiness
      ([guide 09](../guides/09_api_endpoints.md))
- [ ] Branch `feat/<issue>-<slug>` off up-to-date `develop` — hand-written kebab-case name, never a
      tool-generated one like `claude/...` (rename with `git branch -m` first)
- [ ] Build layer by layer with small conventional commits: `domain → data → presentation → tests → docs`
- [ ] Meet the Definition of Done ([`OSTA_plan.md` §16](OSTA_plan.md)): light+dark · RTL+LTR · responsive ·
      state quartet (skeleton/empty/error/offline) · offline policy · animations · talker · tokens only ·
      goldens · dartdoc
- [ ] Update the mandatory four docs (CHANGELOG, DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_SUMMARY, CURRENT_STATUS, feature doc)
- [ ] Bilingual PR to `develop` linking the epic (`Closes #NN`) → CI green → review → merge (a completed milestone ships to `main` via a `develop → main` release PR + tag)

---

## Phase 9 — Production readiness & launch → 🏷️ `v1.0.0`

### 9.1 App identity & platform config

- [ ] Confirm final Android `applicationId` + iOS bundle identifier (rename from defaults if needed)
- [ ] App display name (ar + en), launcher icons (adaptive Android + iOS set), branded native splash
      (`flutter_native_splash` — added in #37)
- [ ] Android: `targetSdk`/`compileSdk` current per Play policy; R8/ProGuard keep-rules verified for maps,
      Firebase, sqflite; `android:allowBackup`/network-security config reviewed
- [ ] iOS: minimum iOS version set; `Info.plist` usage strings (ar+en) for location, camera, photo library,
      notifications
- [ ] Permissions audit — request-in-context only (location on map open, notifications on first relevant entry,
      camera/gallery on avatar/product upload)

### 9.2 Third-party services (production credentials)

- [ ] **Google Maps**: Cloud project + billing; separate restricted API keys for Android (SHA-1/SHA-256 +
      package) and iOS (bundle id); keys injected via build config — **never committed**
- [ ] **Firebase (push only)**: production project; Android + iOS apps registered; `google-services.json` /
      `GoogleService-Info.plist` in place; APNs auth key uploaded; FCM server credentials handed to backend
      (backend M7)
- [ ] **Google Sign-In**: OAuth clients for Android (both SHA fingerprints) + iOS; consent screen approved
- [ ] **Sign in with Apple**: capability enabled; Services ID + key configured with the backend (Socialite)
- [ ] **Paymob** ⛔: production merchant + HMAC on the backend; app E2E against sandbox (wallets + InstaPay),
      then one live smoke payment + refund path verified
- [ ] **Reverb websockets**: production host/port/TLS reachable from devices; `POST /broadcasting/auth` verified
      against production Sanctum
- [ ] Production `BASE_URL` (`https://osta.technology92.com/api/v1`) supplied via `--dart-define` in release CI — no
      hardcoded hosts anywhere (audit)

### 9.3 Signing & store accounts

- [ ] Android: release keystore generated + stored in secrets manager; `key.properties` git-ignored; **Play App
      Signing** enrolled
- [ ] iOS: Apple Developer Program; distribution certificate + provisioning profiles (push + Sign in with Apple
      capabilities)
- [ ] Google Play Console app created — store listing **ar + en**, screenshots (both themes, RTL), feature
      graphic, content rating, **Data safety form**, privacy policy URL (public, matches #38 content)
- [ ] App Store Connect app created — listing ar + en, screenshots, **privacy nutrition labels**, export
      compliance, sign-in test account + review notes for App Review

### 9.4 Release engineering

- [ ] CI release workflow: tag `v*` → build signed AAB + iOS archive (release mode, prod `BASE_URL`) → upload
      artifacts (extends the single-job CI; see [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](../../docs/ROADMAP.md) Phase 4)
- [ ] Crash/error reporting decision + wiring (talker is device-local only): Sentry (no extra Firebase surface)
      vs Crashlytics — record as an ADR in [`osta_readme_files/decisions/`](../decisions/README.md)
- [ ] Store-listing assets pipeline: screenshot set regenerated per release (light/dark × ar/en)
- [ ] Versioning check: `pubspec.yaml` `X.Y.Z+B` matches tag; build number monotonic across both stores

### 9.5 Hardening & QA gate (MVP regression)

- [ ] Full manual regression matrix: **2 shells × ar/en × light/dark** on min-spec Android + iPhone hardware
- [ ] Offline drill: airplane-mode pass over every §7-cached screen; queued mutations sync on reconnect; no
      data loss
- [ ] Realtime drill: kill/restore network mid-booking; poll fallback + reconcile verified on customer +
      business sides
- [ ] Push drill (#52): all three app states (foreground/background/terminated) on both platforms; deep links
      land correctly on both shells
- [ ] Payments drill ⛔ (#46, when live): success / decline / timeout / cancel / double-tap-retry — no double
      charge
- [ ] Performance pass: cold start, map scrolling, list jank (DevTools); app size check
      (`--analyze-size`); `cached_network_image` everywhere images load
- [ ] Accessibility pass: TalkBack/VoiceOver on core flows; contrast suite green; text scale 2.0 without
      overflow; touch targets ≥48dp
- [ ] Security review: no secrets in repo/history; tokens only in `TokenStorage`; talker redaction verified in
      release build; HTTPS everywhere; WebView (Paymob) restricted to gateway origin
- [ ] L10n audit: ARB parity test green; no untranslated strings in either locale; EGP/date/digit formatting
      spot-check in ar_EG
- [ ] `flutter analyze` zero infos on release branch; all tests + goldens green in CI

### 9.6 Beta → launch

- [ ] Internal testing track (Play) + TestFlight build distributed to the team (youssef · haidy · adel · roaa ·
      haneen) — one full bug-bash cycle, issues filed and triaged
- [ ] Closed beta with real users (staged Play track + TestFlight external) — crash-free sessions ≥ 99.5%
      before promoting
- [ ] Store submissions passed review on both platforms
- [ ] 🏷️ Tag **`v1.0.0`** on `main`; CHANGELOG cut; GitHub Release with bilingual notes + artifacts
- [ ] **Staged rollout**: Play 10% → 50% → 100%; iOS phased release ON — monitor crash reporting + backend
      error rates at each step
- [ ] Post-launch watch (first 72h): crash triage SLO, store reviews replied to (ar/en), hotfix path exercised
      if needed (`v1.0.x`)

## Phase 10 — Post-launch & Phase 2 (post-`v1.0.0`)

- [ ] ⛔ Merge **Paymob #46** if it missed the v1.0.0 train (ship as `v1.1.0`)
- [ ] ⛔ **Business More hub + extras** [#58](https://github.com/YoussefSalem582/Osta-App/issues/58) —
      role-agnostic `ProviderMoreShell`, analytics, capacity, reviews inbox (backend M6)
- [ ] ⛔ **Solo-mechanic flow** [#59](https://github.com/YoussefSalem582/Osta-App/issues/59) — enable chooser
      tile; skills + map-drawn service area; provider shell behind capability flags
- [ ] ⛔ **Tow-truck flow** [#60](https://github.com/YoussefSalem582/Osta-App/issues/60) — roadside jobs queue;
      live GPS over `tracking.{jobId}`; customer live-tracking map
- [ ] Revisit deferred tooling per [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](../../docs/ROADMAP.md) (json_serializable → freezed →
      injectable → flavors/CI matrix → fpdart) — one phase at a time, only when the team agrees
- [ ] Sync `AGENTS.md` with the four `OSTA_plan.md` amendments (talker, skeletonizer, offline-first,
      releases/tags) — small `docs/` branch

---

## Standing rules while working this list

- Milestones are sequential; epics **within** a phase can proceed in parallel across owners when their
  dependencies are merged (e.g. #34 needs #33; #39 needs #35; #55's assign picker needs #62).
- ⛔ items never block the train — skip and revisit; releases cut whatever is merged and green.
- `main` stays releasable after every merge; every phase ends with its 🏷️ tag.
- When anything here conflicts with [`OSTA_plan.md`](OSTA_plan.md) or [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md), those win
  (precedence: [`OSTA_plan.md` §3](OSTA_plan.md)).
